# Task 35: Setup Output Messages Show Instructions Instead of Results

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
The setup.sh completion messages tell the user to do things the script should have already done (e.g., "1. cd $TARGET_PATH" when the script could report it already changed there, "4. Create your first task using..." when scripts are already executable).

## Success criteria
Output messages should report what was accomplished, not instruct what to do next:
- "✓ Scripts are executable at work/scripts/"
- "✓ Documentation available at DOCUMENTATION.md"
- "✓ Task templates ready in work/tasks/"
- Only show actual next steps that require user action

- [x] Output messages confirm completed actions
- [x] No redundant instructions for completed tasks
- [x] Clear distinction between what was done and what user needs to do
- [x] Concise, informative completion summary

## Implementation Notes
- Updated completion output to show what was accomplished with checkmarks
- Replaced instruction-style messages with result confirmations
- Added structured sections: "What's ready for you", "Project Structure", "Available Scripts"
- Maintained platform-specific information but reframed as what was installed
