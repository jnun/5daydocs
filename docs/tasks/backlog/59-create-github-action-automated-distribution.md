# Task 59: Create GitHub Action for Automated Distribution Builds

**Status**: BACKLOG
**Feature**: /docs/features/dual-repository-architecture.md
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Problem Statement

The dual-repository architecture feature mentions GitHub Actions for automated distribution builds, but this automation doesn't exist yet. Currently, distribution builds must be run manually using `scripts/build-distribution.sh`.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/build-distribution.yml` workflow file
- [ ] Trigger on releases or tags to main branch
- [ ] Automatically run build-distribution.sh script
- [ ] Push changes to 5daydocs distribution repository
- [ ] Add appropriate secrets configuration documentation
- [ ] Test with a sample release

## Technical Notes

GitHub Action should:
1. Checkout dogfooding repository
2. Run build-distribution.sh
3. Clone/checkout distribution repository
4. Copy built files to distribution repo
5. Commit and push to distribution repo
6. Tag with appropriate version

Required secrets:
- DISTRIBUTION_REPO_TOKEN (PAT with write access to distribution repo)
- DISTRIBUTION_REPO_URL

## Testing

1. Create test release/tag
2. Verify workflow triggers
3. Check distribution repository receives updates
4. Confirm clean build without project-specific files
5. Verify version tags align between repositories
