# Task 43: Ensure All Scripts Are Executable After Setup

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
Scripts need execute permissions to work. Setup.sh sets permissions but needs to verify all scripts in work/scripts/ are executable after copying.

## Success criteria
- All .sh files in work/scripts/ have execute permissions
- Script reports which scripts were made executable
- Works on Mac, Linux, and WSL
- Handles both new installations and updates

- [ ] After setup, can run ./work/scripts/create-task.sh directly
- [ ] After setup, can run ./work/scripts/analyze-feature-alignment.sh directly
- [ ] Permissions persist after git clone
