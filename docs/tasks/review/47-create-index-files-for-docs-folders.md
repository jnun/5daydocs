# Task 47: Create INDEX.md Files for Docs Folders

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
The docs/ folder and its subfolders need INDEX.md files to explain their purpose in documenting the project. These files don't currently exist.

## Success criteria
Create INDEX.md files for:
- docs/INDEX.md - explains documentation structure and organization
- docs/features/INDEX.md - explains feature documentation and status tracking
- docs/guides/INDEX.md - explains technical guides and how-to documentation

- [ ] Each INDEX.md clearly explains the folder's purpose
- [ ] Difference between features/ and guides/ is clear
- [ ] Status tag system (LIVE, TESTING, WORKING, BACKLOG) is explained
