# Task 30: Jira Integration Setup

**Feature**: /docs/features/jira-integration.md
**Created**: 2025-01-20

## Problem
Teams using Jira for project management need automatic synchronization between the 5DayDocs task system and Jira tickets, similar to the existing GitHub Issues integration.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Jira tickets created automatically when tasks are added to backlog/ or next/
- [x] Ticket status updates when tasks move between folders
- [x] Tickets transition to Done when tasks reach live/
- [x] Support for both GitHub Actions and Bitbucket Pipelines
- [x] Clear documentation for setup and configuration
- [x] Bidirectional sync with Git as source of truth
- [x] Automatic import of Jira-created tickets to Git
- [x] Conflict resolution that maintains Git authority

## Notes
Implementation complete with full bidirectional sync:
- Push sync: Git changes update Jira immediately
- Pull reconciliation: Jira tickets imported to Git every 15 minutes
- Git remains authoritative source of truth
- Automatic ID assignment and STATE.md management
- Comprehensive documentation in docs/guides/
