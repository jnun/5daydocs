**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem

## Success criteria

- work/INDEX.md - explains work folder structure and workflow
- work/tasks/INDEX.md - explains task lifecycle and folder flow
- work/bugs/INDEX.md - explains bug tracking and archiving process

- work/designs/INDEX.md - explains design documentation storage
- work/examples/INDEX.md - explains code examples and snippets usage
- work/data/INDEX.md - explains test/sample data storage

- [ ] Each INDEX.md clearly explains the folder's purpose
- [ ] Instructions are concise and actionable
- [ ] File references are accurate
