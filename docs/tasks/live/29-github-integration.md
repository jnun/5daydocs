# Task 29: Add GitHub Issues Integration

**Feature**: /docs/features/github-integration.md
**Created**: 2025-01-19

## Problem
The 5DayDocs system needs automatic synchronization with GitHub Issues to provide visibility for stakeholders who prefer GitHub's interface while maintaining the folder-based system as the source of truth.

## Success Criteria
- [x] GitHub Action creates issues when tasks are added to backlog/ or next/
- [x] Issue labels update automatically when tasks move between folders
- [x] Issues close automatically when tasks reach live/
- [x] No manual commands or CLI tools required for basic operation
- [x] Documentation clearly explains the integration

## Notes
This task tracks the implementation of the GitHub integration feature that was just added to the system. Moving this task through the pipeline will test the integration itself.
