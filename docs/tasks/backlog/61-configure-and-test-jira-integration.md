# Task 61: Configure and Test Jira Integration

**Status**: BACKLOG
**Feature**: /docs/features/jira-integration.md
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Problem Statement

Jira integration feature is documented but remains in BACKLOG status. The integration workflow files exist but need configuration with proper credentials and testing to move to LIVE status.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Document required Jira instance setup steps
- [ ] Create sample .env or secrets configuration template
- [ ] Test with actual Jira instance (Cloud API v3)
- [ ] Verify task creation in Jira from 5daydocs
- [ ] Confirm status transitions work correctly
- [ ] Update feature status from BACKLOG to LIVE
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Notes

Configuration needed:
1. JIRA_BASE_URL - Instance URL
2. JIRA_USER_EMAIL - API user email
3. JIRA_API_TOKEN - Generated from Atlassian account
4. JIRA_PROJECT_KEY - Target project key
5. Custom field ID for 5-Day Task ID

Testing scenarios:
- New task creation → Jira ticket created
- Task moved to working/ → Jira status "In Progress"
- Task moved to review/ → Jira status "In Review"
- Task moved to live/ → Jira status "Done"
- Task deleted → Jira ticket closed

## Testing

1. Set up test Jira project
2. Configure GitHub/Bitbucket secrets
3. Create test task and verify Jira ticket
4. Move task through all states
5. Verify bidirectional references
6. Test error handling (invalid credentials, network issues)
7. Document setup process for users
