# Task 53: Dogfood: Use GitHub Issues for 5DayDocs Project

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
The 5daydocs project itself should use its own GitHub Issues workflow to demonstrate the system and "eat our own dogfood". This will help validate the workflow and provide a real-world example.

## Success criteria
- Enable GitHub Issues on the 5daydocs repository
- Configure the sync-tasks-to-issues.yml workflow
- Ensure all existing tasks in work/tasks/ sync to GitHub Issues
- Use the project as a live demonstration of the 5DayDocs workflow

## Implementation Details
1. Enable GitHub Issues in repository settings
2. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for task syncing
3. Set up proper labels (backlog, next, working, review, live)
4. Create initial issues from existing tasks
5. Document the setup process as a guide for users

- [ ] GitHub Issues are enabled on the repository
- [ ] Workflow syncs tasks to issues automatically
- [ ] Moving tasks between folders updates issue labels
- [ ] Task IDs in filenames match issue numbers
