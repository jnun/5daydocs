# Task 45: Add Setup Complete Success Validation

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Related Tasks
- Do this last (validates all other setup.sh improvements)

## Problem
Setup.sh should verify that everything was set up correctly before declaring success, and provide a clear summary of what's ready to use.

## Success criteria
After setup, script validates:
- All required directories exist
- All required files are present
- Scripts are executable
- Shows clear summary of what's ready
- Provides immediate next action (not a list of instructions)

- [ ] Setup reports specific counts (X folders created, Y files copied, Z scripts ready)
- [ ] If anything failed, clear error message
- [ ] User can immediately run a 5daydocs command after setup
