# Task 36: Research Bitbucket and Jira Integration Requirements

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
The setup.sh script offers "Bitbucket with Jira" as an option but we don't have documentation or implementation for what this actually requires. Need to understand what files, workflows, and configuration are needed for Bitbucket+Jira integration.

## Success criteria
- Document what Bitbucket Pipelines configuration is needed
- Identify what Jira integration points are available
- Understand how task syncing works between Bitbucket and Jira
- Determine what files/scripts are needed for Bitbucket (equivalent to GitHub Actions)
- Create a clear specification for implementation

- [ ] Research document created with Bitbucket+Jira requirements
- [ ] List of required configuration files identified
- [ ] Comparison table of GitHub Actions vs Bitbucket Pipelines approach
