# Task 70: Clean Up Old Template Directories

## Objective
Remove the old, now-empty template directories after migration is complete

## Directories to Remove
1. `/distribution-templates/` (should be empty after task 67)
2. `/docs/work/templates/` (should be empty after task 67)
3. Old structure in `/templates/` (github-workflows/, etc. - after task 68)

## Commands
```bash
# Verify directories are empty first
ls -la distribution-templates/
ls -la docs/work/templates/
ls -la templates/github-workflows/ 2>/dev/null

# Remove empty directories
rmdir distribution-templates
rmdir docs/work/templates
rmdir templates/github-workflows 2>/dev/null
```

## Dependencies
- Tasks 67, 68, and 69 must be completed
- Verify setup.sh works with new paths before cleanup

## Success Criteria
- Old template directories removed
- Only `/templates/` with new structure remains
- setup.sh continues to work correctly
