# Task 89: Execute Structure Flattening on 5daydocs Repository

**Feature**: /docs/features/core-workflow.md
**Created**: 2025-10-19

## Problem
After all scripts, documentation, and migration logic are updated and tested, we need to actually flatten the structure in the 5daydocs repository itself.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Backup current structure
- [ ] Move docs/work/tasks/ to docs/tasks/
- [ ] Move docs/work/bugs/ to docs/bugs/
- [ ] Move docs/work/scripts/ to docs/scripts/
- [ ] Move docs/work/designs/ to docs/designs/
- [ ] Move docs/work/examples/ to docs/examples/
- [ ] Move docs/work/data/ to docs/data/
- [ ] Remove empty docs/work/ directory
- [ ] Verify all files moved correctly
- [ ] Update STATE.md date
- [ ] Commit changes
