# Task 91: Update DOCUMENTATION.md File Structure

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-20

## Problem
The Project Structure section in DOCUMENTATION.md (lines 141-178) shows an outdated file structure that doesn't match the current repository organization. Specifically:
- Shows root-level `/` at the top of the tree
- Includes `scripts/` and `setup.sh` and `5day.sh` at root level that may no longer exist or be in different locations
- The actual structure provided by the user shows the tree starting directly with the folders, not with `/`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] DOCUMENTATION.md Project Structure section matches the actual current repository structure
- [ ] File structure tree starts with actual directories (no leading `/` root)
- [ ] Only files and directories that actually exist are documented
- [ ] Test: Run `tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|.git' .` and verify output matches documented structure
- [ ] Test: Verify each documented file path can be accessed (e.g., `ls docs/STATE.md` succeeds)
- [ ] Test: Grep for outdated paths in DOCUMENTATION.md returns no results for non-existent files

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Generate actual structure
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|.git' . > /tmp/actual-structure.txt

# Test 2: Verify key documented paths exist
test -f docs/STATE.md && echo "✓ docs/STATE.md exists"
test -d docs/tasks/backlog && echo "✓ docs/tasks/backlog exists"
test -d templates/workflows && echo "✓ templates/workflows exists"

# Test 3: Check for outdated references
grep -n "scripts/.*\.sh" DOCUMENTATION.md | grep -v "docs/scripts"
grep -n "setup\.sh" DOCUMENTATION.md | grep -v "After running.*setup\.sh"
```
