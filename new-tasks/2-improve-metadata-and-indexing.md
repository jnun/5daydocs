# Task 2: Improve Metadata and Indexing

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-01

## Problem
Project documentation and workflow files lack consistent metadata and indexing, making it harder for AI and humans to navigate and parse the structure.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Add a top-level README.md or PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md summarizing folder structure and purpose
- [ ] Ensure INDEX.md files exist in every major folder, summarizing contents and linking to sub-items
- [ ] Propose or add metadata files (meta.json or YAML frontmatter) for tasks, features, and bugs to aid AI parsing and categorization
