# Task 78: Create Migration Plan for Flattening docs/work/ Structure

**Feature**: /docs/features/core-workflow.md
**Created**: 2025-10-19

## Problem
The `docs/work/` subdirectory adds unnecessary nesting without clear justification. Need to flatten structure from `docs/work/tasks/` to `docs/tasks/` for simplicity, but this is a breaking change requiring careful migration planning.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Complete analysis of all files/paths that need updating
- [x] Migration strategy documented
- [x] Rollback plan identified
- [x] Breaking changes documented

## Completion Notes
- Analyzed all 30+ files with docs/work/ references
- Created comprehensive task breakdown (Tasks 78-89)
- Migration logic includes automatic backup creation
- Breaking change: Major version bump to 2.0.0 required
