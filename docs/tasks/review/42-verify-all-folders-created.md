# Task 42: Verify All Required Folders Are Created

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2025-10-19


## Problem
Need to ensure setup.sh creates ALL required folders for 5daydocs to function properly, with no missing directories that would cause errors later.

## Success criteria
Setup.sh creates:
- work/tasks/{backlog,next,working,review,live}
- work/{bugs/archived,designs,examples,data,scripts}
- docs/{features,guides}
- .github/workflows (for GitHub platform)

- [ ] Run setup.sh on empty directory - all folders created
- [ ] Run setup.sh on partial structure - missing folders added
- [ ] Verify folder permissions allow read/write
